# VIDLEX-First-Sem-Project
This is a project I made before i had a github account, in my first semester as a Student pursuing Bachelor of Technology:

It was a passion project and it was a lot for me in the first semester but still committed to it,

Its purpose was to convert a Youtube Video to Summarized text with 2 clicks 

These are the following tools and libraries I used:

1. Subprocess
2. pydub
3. speech_recognition
4. ffmpeg
5. Hugging Face Transformers
